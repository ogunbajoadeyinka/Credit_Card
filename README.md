# Credit_Card
"A collection of operations performed to prevent money or property from being acquired under false pretences is known as fraud detection."
Fraud may be committed in a variety of ways and a wide range of sectors. To make a judgment, the majority of detection techniques integrate several fraud detection datasets to provide a linked picture of both legitimate and invalid payment data.
In 2017, 16.7 million people were victims of unauthorized card activities. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the amount of credit card fraud claims in 2017 was 40 per cent greater than the previous year. Around 13,000 instances were recorded in California and 8,000 in Florida, the two states with the highest rates of this sort of crime per capita. By 2020/21, the stakes will have risen to over $30 billion.

Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning is a method that involves a Data Science team investigating data and developing a model that will uncover and prevent fraudulent transactions. This is accomplished by combining all relevant aspects of cardholder transactions, such as Date, User Zone, Product Category, Amount, Provider, Client Behavioral Patterns, and so on. The data is then fed into a model that has been discreetly trained model that finds patterns and rules so that it can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or is legitimate.

+ Detecting fraud automatically
+ Real-time streaming
+ Less time is needed for verification methods
+ Identifying hidden correlations in data

Basis
For this project let's assume you've been employed by a financial Institution (E.g Commercial Bank) to help Customers to be certain that they will not be charged for things they did not buy by detecting possible fraudulent activities. You're provided with a dataset with people's transactions and information on whether or not they're fraudulent, and you're expected to distinguish between them. Today, that will be our quest.
